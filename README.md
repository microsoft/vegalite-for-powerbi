# PowerBi Custom Visual in Vega-Lite

**NOTE: This project is now archived. We recommend https://github.com/deneb-viz/deneb as a well maintained replacement for this project.**

This project demonstrates how [Vega](vega.github.io/vega) and [Vega-Lite](vega.github.io/vega-lite) can be used in custom visuals in PowerBI. This custom visual is not intended for daily use. Think of it as a hello world for Vega and Vega-Lite in PowerBI custom visuals.
